# Development Best Practices

## How to Use

- Read this file to discover which detailed guardrails are available.
- Visit each linked `.mdc` under `ai/ai-meta/best-practices/` for concrete checklists and examples.
- When Strata creates or modifies knowledge, ensure the relevant guideline is respected (and update it if
  project-specific rules evolve).

## Catalog

1. [Component & Knowledge Architecture](./best-practices/index.mdc)
2. [Persistency Layer Lifecycle](./best-practices/best-practice-lifecycle.mdc) *(create as needed)*
3. [Logging & Observability](./best-practices/logging.mdc) *(placeholder for future rules)*

> Add new entries here whenever a guardrail is introduced so the agent can discover it automatically.
