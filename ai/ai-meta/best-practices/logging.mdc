# Logging & Observability Guardrails

- Emit structured logs with context keys: `sessionId`, `workspace`, `repository`, `persistAction`.
- Redact secrets (OAuth tokens, Jira credentials) before logging.
- For persistency-layer writes, log whether write mode was enabled and which `.mdc` paths were touched.
- Surface PR creation/update events to monitoring dashboards so product owners can track knowledge freshness.
