# Best Practices Catalog

This folder hosts detailed, topic-specific guidelines used by Strata and human teammates. Each file should:

- Describe the intent and scope.
- Provide actionable checklists or patterns.
- Reference other `.mdc` files when dependencies exist.

## Initial Stubs

- `best-practice-lifecycle.mdc` — how to introduce, socialize, and retire a guardrail.
- `logging.mdc` — standards for structured logs, observability tags, and escalation workflows.

Add more `.mdc` files here as the project grows (e.g., "prompt-engineering.mdc", "functional-taxonomy-updates.mdc").
