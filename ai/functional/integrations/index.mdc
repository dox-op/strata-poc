# Integrations Index

Track how Strata interacts with external systems:

- Collaboration tooling (Teams, Read.ai) used for requirement intake.
- Jira automation (future) for task creation.
- Code repositories (Bitbucket) for persistency-layer PRs.

Create a dedicated `.mdc` per integration as flows mature and link them here.
