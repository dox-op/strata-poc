# Taxonomy Index

Define shared vocabulary for Strata:

- Personas (Functional Lead, Developer, Client).
- Workflow stages (Capture, Refine, Persist, Implement, Merge).
- Knowledge artifacts (Requirement Draft, Validated Task, Persistency PR).

Create specific taxonomy `.mdc` entries and reference them here so every session uses consistent language.
