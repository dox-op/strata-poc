Use this folder for cross-cutting lifecycle and UI requirements. Suggested topics:

- Session lifecycle (creation, write mode, PR status button).
- Prompt UX and accessibility.
- Persistency layer governance (per-prompt write mode, summaries, indexing rules).

Link each detailed `.mdc` here so stakeholders can navigate requirements quickly.
