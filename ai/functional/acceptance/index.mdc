# Acceptance Index

Document feature-level acceptance criteria here. For each feature:

1. Describe the user story and persona.
2. List acceptance bullets referencing `.mdc` requirements or technical docs.
3. Capture any Strata-specific checkpoints (e.g., write mode enabled, PR created).

Add new `.mdc` files under this folder and link them from this index.
