# Functional Summary

## Mission

Strata transforms the persistency layer into a living, conversational knowledge base that replaces static documentation.
The chatbot (“Strata”) orchestrates creation, validation, and distribution of `.mdc` knowledge for every feature.

## Personas

- **Functional Leads** – capture requirements, refine tasks within Strata, author Jira issues, and open
  persistency-layer PRs.
- **Developers** – consume tasks, ensure the layer is updated in their first commit, and adjust inherited knowledge.
- **Clients** – benefit from consistently curated outputs and up-to-date insights.

## Core Workflow (Single Feature)

1. Capture requirement via external tooling (Teams, Read.ai, ChatGPT).
2. Refine and validate inside a Strata session; consult relevant `.mdc` files.
3. Create Jira task (future automation) once scope is stable.
4. Persist requirement + chain of thought by opening/refreshing a dedicated PR (future automation for branch/PR
   creation).
5. Developers implement the feature with the updated layer, adapting any preloaded knowledge.
6. After merge, new sessions inherit the updated context automatically.

## Automation Backlog

- Auto-hydrate sessions with relevant codebase file summaries.
- Auto-create Jira tasks from validated Strata outputs.
- Auto-create/update persistency PR branches per task.

Keep this summary synchronized whenever workflows change.
